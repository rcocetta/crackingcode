# Cracking the coding interview

##Javascript version

Here's the attempt in Javascript as a Node application.

The code for each chapter will be held in "chapterX.js", the tests in "test_X.js"

To run the tests:

```
npm i
npm test
```
or

```
npm i -g mocha
mocha test_X.js
```

or

```
npm i
 ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test_X.js
```

If needed, a separate implementation of the data structures will be written somewhere.

In **data_structures** you'll find my implementation of the general data structures needed for these excercises.
